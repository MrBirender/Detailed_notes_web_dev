Q3.what is the difference between em and rem?
answer: em is relative to the parent element and rem is relative to
 the root element
 root element means html element means the browsers defalut font size
 we have to use rem everywhere in the project for font size , then it will
 increase the font based on the browser font size. which is 16px by default
 or can be changed by user.

 em should be used for other thing than font size.

 if we use em for the font size on evrthing then it wil be relative
 to the parent element. and it will become very hard to get the real font size
 of the element.

 parent element.
