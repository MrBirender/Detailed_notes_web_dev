Q.How css calulate specificity?
Answer: CSS specificity is a system for determining which style rules apply to a given element. 
It is based on three factors: inline styles, ID selectors, element selectors and class selectors.

order of selectros: inline styles > ID selectors > element selectors > class selectors
which ever selector is used it will become one and rest will become 0. that will be the score.
the higher the score the more specific the selector is.
for ex: i have used inline styles: 1 > 0 > 0 > 0
for ex: i have used ID selector: 0 > 1 > 0 > 0
for ex: i have used class selector: 0 > 0 > 1 > 0
for ex: i have used element selector: 0 > 0 > 0 > 1

if the same thing is targeted consiqutively and with the same slelector then later one will be
appliead because css reads from top to bottom.
