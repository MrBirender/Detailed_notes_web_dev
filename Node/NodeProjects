  - Input validation using middleware.  
  - Handling database operations with Mongoose.  
- **Under-the-Hood Knowledge**:  
  - Middleware chaining and error propagation.  
  - Why validation happens before hitting the controller.

### **3. User Authentication API (Intermediate)**  
**Objective**: Dive into authentication and authorization.  
- **Features**:  
  - User signup and login with hashed passwords using `bcrypt`.  
  - JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.  
  - Protect routes with custom middleware for checking tokens.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Building authentication middleware.  
  - Understanding how tokens are generated and verified.  
  - Role-based access control.  
- **Under-the-Hood Knowledge**:  
  - How JWTs work and where they should be stored (cookies vs. headers).  
  - Middleware for secured routes.

### **4. Task Management System with File Uploads (Intermediate)**  
**Objective**: Implement advanced routing and file handling.  
- **Features**:  
  - Users can create tasks and upload images for each task.  
  - Use `Multer` for file uploads.  
  - Add middleware for file type and size validation.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Advanced routing (nested routes for tasks under users).  
  - File uploads and handling with streams.  
  - Serving static files from a `public` directory.  
- **Under-the-Hood Knowledge**:  
  - How middleware like `Multer` interacts with the request lifecycle.  
  - How streams handle large file uploads.

### **5. Real-Time Chat Application (Advanced)**  
**Objective**: Use `Socket.IO` for real-time functionality and integrate with Express.  
- **Features**:  
  - Real-time messaging between users.  
  - Authentication using JWT for WebSocket connections.  
  - Logging chat history in MongoDB.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Integrating `Socket.IO` with Express middleware.  
  - Handling WebSocket connections securely.  
  - Broadcasting and room-based messaging.  
- **Under-the-Hood Knowledge**:  
  - Event-driven architecture in Node.js.  
  - How WebSocket requests differ from HTTP requests.

### **6. E-commerce API with Payment Gateway (Advanced)**  
**Objective**: Create a full-fledged API with complex middleware logic.  
- **Features**:  
  - Product listing and cart management.  
  - User authentication and role-based access (admin vs. user).  
  - Integrate payment gateways like Stripe or Razorpay.  
  - Rate-limiting middleware to prevent abuse.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Implementing middleware for rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`).  
  - Using middleware for role-based access control.  
  - Payment gateway integration.  
- **Under-the-Hood Knowledge**:

### **7. Blogging Platform with SSR (Challenging)**  
**Objective**: Dive into server-side rendering and advanced request handling.  
- **Features**:  
  - Users can write, edit, and delete blog posts.  
  - Render pages server-side for SEO using a template engine like `EJS` or `Pug`.  
  - Implement pagination and caching for better performance.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Server-side rendering with Express.  
  - Pagination middleware.  
  - Cache middleware using Redis.

  - How template engines process server-side HTML.  
  - How caching reduces database load.  

---

### **8. API Gateway with Microservices (Expert)**  
**Objective**: Build an API gateway that routes requests to different microservices.  
- **Features**:  
  - A gateway service that forwards requests to independent services (e.g., user service, product service).  
  - Authentication and request validation at the gateway level.  
  - Load balancing between microservices.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Proxying requests using `http-proxy-middleware`.
