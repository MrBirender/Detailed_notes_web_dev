Got it, Saarthi is ready to help you deep dive into Node.js! Since you're aiming for 
interview-level understanding and already have experience, weâ€™ll focus on **advanced 
concepts, internals, and practical applications** that often come up in interviews.

Here's a roadmap to guide your learning for today:

---

### **1. Node.js Basics Refresher (Quick Review)**  
Just to ensure there's no gap:  
- **What is Node.js?** Event-driven, non-blocking I/O, single-threaded JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.  
- **Core Modules**: `fs`, `path`, `http`, `os`, `events`, `stream`.  
- **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop): Basics of testing small code snippets in Node.js.  

---

### **2. Key Concepts to Explore**
**(Focus on these for interviews)**  

#### **a. Node.js Architecture**  
- Event Loop (phases: timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, close callbacks).  
- V8 Engine (compilation and optimization).  
- Libuv library (handles async operations, thread pool).  
- Call Stack vs Task Queue vs Microtask Queue.  
- What does "single-threaded" mean in Node.js? How does it handle concurrency?  

ðŸ“Œ **Questions to think about:**  
- Explain how Node.js is non-blocking.  
- How does the Event Loop work?  
- What happens when an async operation is executed?  

#### **b. Module System**  
- CommonJS vs ES Modules (`require` vs `import`).  
- How does the `require` function work under the hood? (Module caching, paths resolution).  
- Implementing your own modules.  
- `exports` vs `module.exports`â€”differences and usage.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- What happens if you require a module twice?  

#### **c. Streams**  
- Types of streams: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.  
- Stream methods: `.pipe()`, `.on()`.  
- Use cases: File I/O, real-time data handling, large data processing.  
- Difference between Streams and Buffers.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- What are streams, and how do they improve performance?  

#### **d. EventEmitter**  
- The `events` module: Understanding `.emit()`, `.on()`, `.once()`.  
- Building your own EventEmitter.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- How is `EventEmitter` used in real-world scenarios?  

#### **e. Middleware & Express.js**  
- Middleware concepts: Custom middleware, error-handling middleware.  
- Built-in middleware vs third-party middleware (`body-parser`, `cors`, etc.).  
- Understanding the request-response lifecycle in Express.js.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- Explain the middleware concept and its role in Express.js.  

#### **f. Asynchronous Programming**  
- Callbacks vs Promises vs Async/Await.  
- Avoiding callback hell.  
- Error handling in async code (`try...catch`, `.catch()`).  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- What are the advantages of `Async/Await` over Promises?  

#### **g. Error Handling**  
- `try...catch` vs Centralized error handling in Express.  
- Global error handling with `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')`.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- How do you handle unhandled promise rejections in Node.js?  

#### **h. Security**  
- Preventing vulnerabilities:  
  - SQL Injection.  
  - NoSQL Injection.  
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  
  - Rate Limiting.  
- Common security packages: `helmet`, `dotenv`, `cors`.  
- OWASP best practices for Node.js.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- How do you secure a Node.js application?  

#### **i. Clustering and Load Balancing**  
- Using the `cluster` module to scale Node.js apps.  
- Difference between scaling vertically and horizontally.  
- PM2 (Process Manager) for production.  

ðŸ“Œ **Interview Question:**  
- How does Node.js handle scalability?

### **3. Under-the-Hood Insights**  
#### **a. How Node.js Manages Asynchronous Operations**  
- Explain the relationship between the Event Loop, Libuv, and Thread Pool.  
- Tasks handled by the Event Loop (e.g., `setTimeout`) vs Thread Pool (e.g., `crypto`).  

#### **b. Garbage Collection in Node.js**  
- V8 Engine's memory management.  
- Mark-and-sweep algorithm.  
- Memory leaks and tools to detect them (`heapdump`, Chrome DevTools).  

---

### **4. Hands-On Practice for Interviews**  
#### **a. Code Challenges**  
1. Write a custom implementation of `EventEmitter`.  
2. Build a simple stream-based file read/write program.  
3. Create a middleware in Express that logs requests.  
4. Use Promises to chain asynchronous operations and handle errors properly.  

#### **b. Debugging in Node.js**  
- Debugging tools: `node inspect`, Chrome DevTools, `console.log`.  

---

### **5. Bonus: Mock Questions**  
1. How does `require` work internally in Node.js?  
2. What are the differences between `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`?  
3. Explain the lifecycle of an HTTP request in Node.js.  
4. What is the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?

### **6. Resources to Learn**  
1. **Official Docs**: [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)  
2. **Deep Dives**: [Node.js Design Patterns](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/)  
3. **YouTube Channels**: Academind, Fireship, Traversy Media.  
4. **Practice Sites**: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codewars (for async programming challenges).
