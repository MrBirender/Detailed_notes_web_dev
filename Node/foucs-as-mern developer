Where to Focus as a MERN Stack Developer
As a MERN stack developer, prioritize these use cases:

RESTful APIs: Backbone of any full-stack app.
Real-Time Features: Learn Socket.IO for real-time collaboration/chat features.
Authentication: Implement JWT, OAuth, and role-based access control.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Master Next.js for React SSR.
File Uploads and Media Handling: Learn file streaming and handling user uploads.
Security: Secure your backend with best practices (e.g., helmet, csrf, express-rate-limit).
Performance Optimization: Use caching (Redis) and implement load balancing.
Suggested Learning Path
