### 🔐 **SSH (Secure Shell) – Summary**

**What is it?**  
SSH is a **secure protocol** used to **remotely access and control servers** over a network.

---

### 🛠️ **Key Uses**
- Remotely **log in to servers**
- **Run commands** on remote machines
- **Transfer files** securely (via `scp` or `rsync`)
- Used in **deployments** (e.g., GitHub Actions, CI/CD)

---

### 🔑 **Authentication Methods**
- **Username & Password** (less secure)  
- **SSH Key Pair** (recommended):
  - **Private Key** → stays on your machine
  - **Public Key** → stored on the server

---

### 💻 **Basic Commands**
```bash
ssh user@server-ip        # Connect to server
scp file.txt user@ip:/path  # Copy file to server
ssh-keygen -t rsa         # Generate SSH keys
ssh-copy-id user@ip       # Copy public key to server
```

### 🔒 Why Use SSH in Deployment?
- Enables **secure, automated access** to servers  
- Commonly used in CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions)  
- Eliminates need to manually log into server every time
