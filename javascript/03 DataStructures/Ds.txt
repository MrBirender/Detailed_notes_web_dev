Question: What is the difference between datatypes and datastructures?
         datatypes: 
            as the name suggest it defines by how many types we can store data.
            ex: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint, object, function. 

         dataStructures: 
            a data structure is a way how we store and organise data for efficient access and modification.
            

         built in data structures: 
            arrays, objects, sets, maps, weakMap, weakSet.

         external data structues: 
            queue, stack, linked list, binary tree, binary search tree, heap.

Question: what are the algorithms?
         algorithms are the set of steps to solve a problem.

         inbuilt in js:
           ex: sort, math.max math.min , set, map
        

         external algorithms:
         ex: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort.


         Question: what is maps and sets and is there any other data type in js.?
    Answer: set, map, weakMap ,weakSet, typedArray, arrayBuffer are the other data strucutres.
