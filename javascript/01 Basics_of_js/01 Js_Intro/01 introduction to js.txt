1. // why we use nodejs in the vs code . give at least one replacment for nodejs.
-- Answer: we use nodejs in vs Code to run js outside the browser, earlier it was only
possible in the browser itself. but now it has opened the door for server side development.
[Deno is the replacment for node.]

what is nodejs?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side applications, which means you can build the backend of web 
applications or even entire software solutions using JavaScript.

-- type node in the console and hit enter then it will give me the nodejs enviorment where i can perfrom operation 
in the cosnole on vs code outside the browser.



2. // what is vs code is there any other replacment for it.
-- Answer: vsCode is a free code editor by Microsoft. Sublime and Atom- (by github) are the alternatives.

3. / what is git and github and the codespace option in git is for what and why to stop git machine after use?
-- Answer:  git is a local version control of your project, it allows you to create versions of your project
on your computer.Git allows you to create branches to try out new features withtout affecting the main
project. Git works offline so, all of your changes will be availble locally unless you share them.


->  Github: it is a cloud based storage of your local git repositry and it acts as a central repostiry where
anyone can clone and contribute to it. with it's bakcup of the local repositry we can access it from anywhere
and from any machine.

--> codespace in github is the develpment enviorment.

4. what is difference between git and gitBash?
--Answer: Git bash is a command line application that gives user , access to unix like shell making it
easier to use git.

-- gitbash is a unix like interface because unix/linux was one of the oldest OS for develpors which provided
a complete control over sytem , it was used by reseachers, scientists and develpers but windows was build for
the different customers, it was for general people, it was bases on GUI. this is why we use gitbash to create
the same interface for the develpers.


5. // what is the difference between var, const, let and why i should not use var in my code
Answer: it is in index.js file:" var is outdated now , it should not be used now because of its inexpected
scopping behaviour.

** let and const respects the blockscope but var doen't if we declare another varibale with the same name
in the diffrent scope , then the previous one gets updated.
function myFunction() {
    var name = 'john'
    if(4< 5) {
        var name = 'birender'

        console.log(name)
    }
    console.log(name)
    

}

Redeclaration:
var: ✅ Allowed.
let and const: ❌ Not allowed.


Reassignment:
var and let: ✅ Allowed.
const: ❌ Not allowed (values can't be reassigned).

Summary
Redeclaration: Creating a new variable with the same name in the same scope.
var x = 10; 
var x = 20; // Redeclaration (allowed with `var`)

Reassignment: Updating the value of an existing variable.
let y = 10; 
y = 20; // Reassignment (allowed with `let`)

myFunction() // birender // birender

6. // can i store a variable in the memeory without using var, let and const
Answer: yes data can be stored but it is bad practice it will give error in usestrict mode in js;

/* tc39.es ecma script is the offical documentaion for js.
mdn is from mozilla group. */

7. what are the data types in js and what if we do type check on them.  
Answer: There are mainly two types of data types in js:
primitive and non-primitive.

1. primitive - These data types are immutable and stored by value in memory.
- 7types in total: 
number:
let age = 25; // Integer
let price = 19.99; // Float
let infinity = Infinity; // Special numeric value
let notANumber = NaN; // "Not a Number"

string, boolean,

 bigInt: it starts after 2**52, before that we can use number
 let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // Add 'n' for BigInt


 undefined:
let unassigned;
console.log(unassigned); // undefined

 
 null:
 let emptyValue = null;

  symbol:
  let id = Symbol("uniqueId");


2. non-primitive - These data types are mutable and stored by refrence in memeory.
- 3 types in total: objects, arrays and functions.



** How stored by value and store by refrence works:
This applies to primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, and BigInt).

How It Works
When a variable is assigned a primitive value, the value itself is stored in the variable.
 If the variable is copied to another variable, a new copy of the value is created. 
 Both variables operate independently.

Stored by vlaue: 
let a = 10; // Primitive value stored in 'a'
let b = a;  // 'b' gets a copy of the value of 'a'

b = 20;     // Changing 'b' does not affect 'a'

console.log(a); // 10 (unchanged)
console.log(b); // 20\


Stored by refrence:
This applies to non-primitive (reference) data types such as Objects, Arrays, and Functions.

How It Works
When a variable is assigned a reference type (like an object or array), 
the variable stores a reference (or memory address) pointing to the location of the actual data in memory.
 If the variable is copied to another variable, both variables point to the same memory location. 
 Modifying the data via one variable affects the other


let obj1 = { name: "Alice" }; // Reference to an object
let obj2 = obj1;             // Both 'obj1' and 'obj2' point to the same object

obj2.name = "Bob";           // Modifying 'obj2' affects 'obj1'

console.log(obj1.name); // "Bob"
console.log(obj2.name); // "Bob"

***when the value is reassigned in the refrence type, it doesn't affect the previous value:

let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1; // Both 'arr1' and 'arr2' reference the same array

arr2.push(4);    // Modify the array via 'arr2'

console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (affected)
console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (affected)

arr2 = [5, 6, 7]; // Reassign 'arr2' to a new array

console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (unchanged)
console.log(arr2); // [5, 6, 7] (new array)

8.unusual results after type check on data types in js.
Answer: 
console.log(typeof null); // Output: "object"
null is a primitive data types but it gives obj on type check due to a historical bug in js.

Internally, JavaScript uses a specific internal type tag (a number) to represent different types. 
For most objects, this tag was a unique identifier that indicated it was an object. However, for null, 
the tag that was used was the same tag used for objects. As a result, when the typeof operator was implemented,
 it would return "object" because the internal tag for null was mistakenly treated the same as for regular 
 objects.

Thus, typeof null was returned as "object", even though null was not actually an object.

2. console.log(typeof []); // Output: "object"
Explanation: Arrays are technically objects in JavaScript, so typeof returns "object", which might be
 misleading when you're trying to differentiate between plain objects and arrays.
console.log(Array.isArray([])); // true
console.log(Array.isArray({})); // false

3.console.log(typeof function() {}); // Output: "function"
Explanation: Functions are a special type of object, and typeof returns "function" for them. This can be useful
 for checking if a variable is a function.

4.console.log(typeof NaN); // Output: "number"
Explanation: NaN (Not-a-Number) is technically of type "number" in JavaScript, even though it is not a valid
 number. This can be confusing.
console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN)); // true
console.log(Number.isNaN(42));  // false

5.let x;
console.log(typeof x); // Output: "undefined"
Explanation: undefined is a primitive value and typeof correctly identifies it as "undefined".
 However, you need to ensure that avariable is not unintentionally undefined in your checks.
let x;
console.log(x === undefined); // true

No need to cram! You can break it down systematically by following a logical **decision tree** to

 predict what conversions happen. Here’s a simple approach to help you predict the result of `==` 
 without memorizing everything:

---

### **The Decision Tree for `==`**
1. **Are the two types the same?**
   - If yes, no coercion happens; compare directly.
     ```javascript
     5 == 5; // true
     "hello" == "hello"; // true
     ```
   - If no, move to the next step.

---

2. **Is either value `null` or `undefined`?**
   - `null` and `undefined` are **only equal to each other** and nothing else.
     ```javascript
     null == undefined; // true
     null == 0; // false
     ```

---

3. **Is one of the values a boolean?**
   - Convert the boolean to a **number** (`true → 1`, `false → 0`).
     ```javascript
     true == 1; // true
     false == 0; // true
     true == "1"; // true (true → 1, "1" → 1)
     ```

---

4. **Is one of the values a string?**
   - Convert the string to a **number**, if the other value is a number.
     ```javascript
     "5" == 5; // true ("5" → 5)
     "hello" == 5; // false ("hello" → NaN)
     ```

---

5. **Is one of the values an object (like an array or object)?**
   - Convert the object to a **primitive**:
     1. Call `.valueOf()` on the object.
     2. If `.valueOf()` doesn’t return a primitive, call `.toString()`.
   - Compare the resulting primitive with the other value.
     ```javascript
     [1] == 1; // true ([1] → "1" → 1)
     [] == ""; // true ([] → "" → "")
     {} == "[object Object]"; // false
     ```

---

6. **Default Case:**
   - Coerce both values to **numbers**, then compare.
     ```javascript
     "10" == true; // false ("10" → 10, true → 1)
     ```

---

### **Let’s Apply This Approach to Examples**

| Expression         | Explanation                                      | Result  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `5 == "5"`         | `"5" → 5`                                        | `true`  |
| `null == undefined`| Both are loosely equal.                          | `true`  |
| `true == 1`        | `true → 1`                                       | `true`  |
| `false == 0`       | `false → 0`                                      | `true`  |
| `[1] == 1`         | `[1] → "1" → 1`                                  | `true`  |
| `[] == ""`         | `[] → ""`                                        | `true`  |
| `0 == false`       | `false → 0`                                      | `true`  |
| `null == 0`        | No coercion; `null` only equals `undefined`.      | `false` |

---

### **Pro Tip: Stop Using `==`**
If you're finding `==` tricky, avoid it! Use `===` (strict equality), which does **not** perform type coercion:
```javascript
5 === "5"; // false
null === undefined; // false
true === 1; // false
```

---

### **Practice to Solidify Your Understanding**
Try testing yourself with these:
1. `true == "1"`
2. `null == 0`
3. `[2] == "2"`
4. `undefined == false`
5. `"5" == false`

Let me know if you want me to explain any specific case! 😊

***********************************************************************************************************


6.console.log(NaN === NaN); // Output: false
Explanation: NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, due to the fact that it's 
considered "Not a Number."

7.console.log(0 == false); // Output: true
console.log(0 === false); // Output: false
Explanation: == performs type coercion (changing data types to perform an operation), so 0 and false are 
considered equal in loose comparison, but they are different types and unequal when compared strictly (===).

8.console.log("" == 0); // Output: true
console.log("" === 0); // Output: false
Explanation: When comparing with ==, an empty string is coerced to 0, which can lead to unexpected results.
 However, with strict equality ===, the comparison correctly returns false.

9.console.log([] == false); // Output: true
console.log([] == 0);     // Output: true
Explanation: Empty arrays ([]) are coerced to an empty string when compared with ==, and then the empty string
 is coerced to false or 0. This can lead to confusing results.

10.Explanation: Empty arrays ([]) are coerced to an empty string when compared with ==, and then the empty 
string is coerced to false or 0. This can lead to confusing results.
Explanation: Even though Infinity represents an infinitely large number, it is still of type "number".

11.console.log(0 === -0); // Output: true
console.log(Object.is(0, -0)); // Output: false
Explanation: JavaScript considers 0 and -0 to be the same value when compared using ===, but they are
 distinct when checked with Object.is().

12.const arr1 = [];
const arr2 = [];

console.log(arr1 == arr2);  // Output: false
console.log(arr1 === arr2); // Output: false
In JavaScript, when comparing two arrays (or objects) using either == or ===, reference comparison is performed
not value comparison. This means that even though arr1 and arr2 are both empty arrays, they are still two 
separate objects in memory, and JavaScript will consider them different because they reference different 
locations in memory.


but if :const arr1 = [];
const arr2 = arr1;

console.log(arr1 == arr2) // it will give true
console.log(arr1 === arr2) // it will give true


9. How js works from writing the code till the execution?

### Example revision based on these suggestions:
---

**1. Parsing Phase**:  
This phase involves **syntax analysis**, **hoisting**, and **scope determination**. The JavaScript engine 
scans the code and converts it into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, which represents the logical structure
 of the code. During this phase, **hoisting** occurs, meaning that variable and function declarations are moved to the
  top of their scope before the code starts execution. For example:  

let name = 'Sachin';

The AST will break it down into nodes like `let`, `name`, `=`, `'Sachin'`, and `;`. The `let` declaration is hoisted,
 but its value assignment happens later.

---

**2. JIT Compilation Phase**:  
In this phase, the JavaScript engine converts the **Abstract Syntax Tree** into **bytecode** or **machine code** that 
can be understood by the computer. **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation** means that the code is compiled **during runtime**. 
The engine optimizes the code by **inlining functions**, removing unused code, and making other adjustments to make it
  more efficient.

---

**3. Execution Phase**:  
This is where the compiled code runs step by step. During execution, **variables are resolved**, and functions are
 called. The **call stack** keeps track of the functions being executed, and the **event loop** ensures asynchronous 
 code like `setTimeout` or Promises is handled properly. The code runs according to the scope and context determined 
 earlier.

Here are detailed explanations for your doubts:  

---

### 1. **What does single-threaded mean? Does it mean it has a single call stack?**  
**Answer:** Yes, JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it has **only one call stack** to handle code execution.  
- The **call stack** is a data structure that keeps track of function calls.  
- Being single-threaded means JavaScript can execute **one piece of code at a time**.  
- This design simplifies code execution and avoids complex issues like race conditions found in multi-threaded environments.  

However, asynchronous operations (like `setTimeout`, `fetch`) are handled by **Web APIs** outside the call stack, and their callbacks are pushed back to the call stack when ready.  

---

### 2. **Is Stack a Data Structure?**  
**Answer:** Yes.  
- A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.  
- In JavaScript, the **call stack** works on the same principle. The most recent function call is executed first and popped off the stack when done.  

---

### 3. **What is an Anonymous Function in the Call Stack?**  
**Answer:**  
- An **anonymous function** is a function without a name.  
- In the call stack, if a function is invoked without being assigned to a named identifier, it appears as `(anonymous)` in the stack trace.  

In the example you gave:  
```javascript
function foo() {
  throw new Error('Oops!');
}
function boo() {
  foo();
}
function too() {
  boo();
}
too();
```
The stack trace shows how the error propagates through the call stack. If an error occurs inside an anonymous function, it will show `(anonymous)` in the trace.  

---

### 4. **Range Error: Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded**  
This error occurs when functions call themselves recursively without a proper base case, causing an **infinite loop of function calls** until the stack overflows.  
Example:  
```javascript
function recurse() {
  recurse(); // infinite recursion
}
recurse();
```
Here, each call to `recurse()` adds a new frame to the stack until it exceeds the maximum stack size.  

---

### 5. **Does Async Operations Use Web APIs as Another Thread?**  
**Answer:** Yes, kind of.  
- JavaScript itself is **single-threaded**, but the browser environment (or Node.js) provides **Web APIs** to handle asynchronous operations.  
- When you make an async call (like `setTimeout`, `fetch`), JavaScript offloads this task to the Web API, which operates outside the main thread.  
- Once the operation completes, its callback is pushed to the **task queue**, and the **event loop** manages pushing it back to the call stack when it's empty.  

This mechanism makes JavaScript behave **asynchronously** even though it's single-threaded.  

---

### 6. **What Are Various APIs in the Web API?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Timers:** `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `requestAnimationFrame()`  
- **HTTP Requests:** `fetch()`, `XMLHttpRequest (XHR)`  
- **DOM Events:** Event listeners for clicks, scrolls, etc.  
- **Geolocation API**, **WebSockets**, **File API**, etc.  

---

### 7. **Does the Event Loop Check if the Call Stack is Empty Before Pushing Callbacks?**  
**Answer:** Yes.  
- The **event loop** continuously checks if the call stack is empty.  
- When it's empty, the event loop pushes callbacks from the **task queue** to the call stack for execution.  
- This mechanism ensures non-blocking, asynchronous behavior.  

---

### 8. **What Happens with `setTimeout` with 0 ms?**  
**Answer:**  
- Even with `setTimeout(() => console.log('Hello'), 0)`, the callback is **not executed immediately**.  
- It is handled by the Web API and pushed to the **task queue**. The event loop will move it to the call stack **only after** the current stack is empty.  

So, it's a **minimum delay** of 0 ms, but actual execution depends on the call stack's state.  

---

### 9. **Is `setTimeout` a Guaranteed Timer?**  
**Answer:** No, it's not guaranteed.  
- The delay in `setTimeout` is the **minimum time** before the callback gets pushed to the queue.  
- If the call stack is busy, the callback will be delayed beyond the specified time.  

Example:  
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('1'), 1000);
setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 1000);
setTimeout(() => console.log('3'), 1000);
setTimeout(() => console.log('4'), 1000);
```
Here, all callbacks are scheduled for after 1000 ms, but they will execute **one after another**, depending on the event loop and the call stack's availability.  

---

### 10. **How Does Rendering Work in Relation to the Call Stack?**  
**Answer:**  
- The browser uses the **render queue** to handle visual updates.  
- Rendering is typically handled during the **"render phase"** of the event loop.  
- After the call stack is empty, the browser gets a chance to render UI changes.  
- This happens approximately **every 16 ms** (~60 frames per second) for smooth animations.  

If the call stack is blocked (e.g., by heavy computations), the browser can't render, causing **jank** or **lag**.
