/*************  ✨ Codeium Command 🌟  *************/
1. // why we use nodejs in the vs code . give at least one replacment for nodejs.
      -- Answer: we use nodejs in vs Code to run js outside the browser, earlier it was only
      possible in the browser itself. but now it has opened the door for server side development.
      [Deno is the replacment for node.]

what is nodejs?

    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
    It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side applications, which means you can build the backend of web 
    applications or even entire software solutions using JavaScript.

    -- type node in the console and hit enter then it will give me the nodejs enviorment where i can perfrom operation 
    in the cosnole on vs code outside the browser.



2. // what is vs code is there any other replacment for it.
    -- Answer: vsCode is a free code editor by Microsoft. Sublime and Atom- (by github) are the alternatives.

3. / what is git and github and the codespace option in git is for what and why to stop git machine after use?
    -- Answer:  git is a local version control of your project, it allows you to create versions of your project
    on your computer.Git allows you to create branches to try out new features withtout affecting the main
    project. Git works offline so, all of your changes will be availble locally unless you share them.


  ->  Github: it is a cloud based storage of your local git repositry and it acts as a central repostiry where
  anyone can clone and contribute to it. with it's bakcup of the local repositry we can access it from anywhere
  and from any machine.

  --> codespace in github is the develpment enviorment.

4. what is difference between git and gitBash?
      --Answer: Git bash is a command line application that gives user , access to unix like shell making it
      easier to use git.

      -- gitbash is a unix like interface because unix/linux was one of the oldest OS for develpors which provided
      a complete control over sytem , it was used by reseachers, scientists and develpers but windows was build for
      the different customers, it was for general people, it was bases on GUI. this is why we use gitbash to create
the same interface for the develpers.


  5. // what is the difference between var, const, let and why i should not use var in my code
          *difference on the basis:
          1. scopping
          2. hoisting


          #### **1️⃣ Scoping**  
          - `var` is **function-scoped**, meaning it is only restricted within the function where it is declared. However, if declared inside a block (like an `if` statement or loop), it **leaks out of the block** and remains accessible outside.  
          - `let` and `const` are **block-scoped**, meaning they are confined within the block `{}` where they are declared and cannot be accessed outside.  
          - If a `var` variable is declared inside a function, it does not leak, but if declared inside a block (outside a function), it does.  

#### **2️⃣ Hoisting**  
      - Hoisting is the process where JavaScript moves **variable and function declarations** to the top of their scope before executing the code.  
      - `var` is hoisted **and initialized with `undefined`**, meaning it can be accessed before its declaration, but its value will be `undefined` until assigned.  
      - `let` and `const` are hoisted **but not initialized**, meaning they exist in a **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** from the start of the scope until their declaration. Accessing them before declaration results in a **ReferenceError**.  
      - Function **declarations** are fully hoisted along with their body, meaning they can be called before being defined.  
      - Function **expressions** (where functions are assigned to variables) are not hoisted with their body. If declared using `var`, they get initialized with `undefined`, and if declared with `let` or `const`, accessing them before declaration results in a **ReferenceError**.  

#### **3️⃣ Why Should You Avoid `var`?**  
      - **Does not respect block scope**, leading to unexpected behavior.  
      - **Hoisted with `undefined`**, which can cause unpredictable results.  
      - **Allows redeclaration in the same scope**, increasing the chances of unintentional overwrites.  
      - `let` and `const` ensure **better scoping, safer behavior, and cleaner code**.  

      Using `let` and `const` improves code reliability, reduces errors, and enhances maintainability. 🚀



6. // can i store a variable in the memeory without using var, let and const
      Answer: yes data can be stored but it is bad practice it will give error in use strict mode in js;

      /* tc39.es ecma script is the offical documentaion for js.
mdn is from mozilla group. */

7. what are the data types in js and what if we do type check on them.  
      1.Primitive
      2.Non- primitive


      1️⃣ Primitive Data Types (Immutable & Stored by Value)
      There are 7 primitive types:

      Number → Represents numerical values (e.g., 1, 3.14, -42).
      String → Represents text data (e.g., "hello", 'world').
      Boolean → Represents true or false.
      Undefined → A variable declared but not assigned any value.
      Null → Represents an intentional absence of value.
      BigInt → Used for very large integers (BigInt(9007199254740991n)).
      Symbol → Unique and immutable value, often used as object keys.



      =>2️⃣Type Checking for Primitives (typeof Operator)
          Data Type	typeof Result
          Number	"number"
      => sub type of number: 
          NaN is NOT a separate data type. It is a special value within the Number type that represents an invalid mathematical operation. 🚀

          String	"string"
          Boolean	"boolean"
          Undefined	"undefined"
          Null	"object" (Bug in JavaScript)
            explaination: Internally, JavaScript uses a specific internal type tag (a number) to         represent different types. 
                For most objects, this tag was a unique identifier that indicated it was an object. However, for null, 
                the tag that was used was the same tag used for objects. As a result, when the typeof operator was implemented,
                it would return "object" because the internal tag for null was mistakenly treated the same as for regular objects.
                Thus, typeof null was returned as "object", even though null was not actually an object.
                BigInt	"bigint"
                Symbol	"symbol"
          
          
      => Non-Primitive Data Types (Mutable & Stored by Reference)
          There are 3 main non-primitive types:

          Object → A collection of key-value pairs { name: "John", age: 25 }.
          Array → A special type of object that holds ordered values [1, 2, 3].
          Function → A callable object function greet() { return "Hello"; }.


      => Type Checking for Non-Primitives (typeof Operator)
          Data Type	typeof Result
          Object	"object"
          Array	"object" (Arrays are a type of object)
          Function	"function" (A callable object)

      => Important Notes & Common Mistakes
          typeof null returns "object" → This is a known JavaScript bug from the early days.
          Arrays are objects → To check if a value is an array, use Array.isArray(arr).
          Functions are objects too → But typeof specifically returns "function".
          typeof NaN returns "number" → NaN (Not a Number) is still considered a number in JavaScript.



Question:** How stored by value and store by refrence works:### 

=> These are the two methods JavaScript uses to store data in memory:  


### **By-Value (Stack Memory)**  
      - **Used for primitive data types** (Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol).  
      - Stored in the **stack memory**, where both the variable and its value are kept.  
      - When assigned to a new variable, **a copy of the value** is created.  
      - The two variables are **independent** of each other, meaning changes in one do not affect the other.  

      **Example Concept:**  
      - If a variable holds a primitive value and is assigned to another variable, a new copy is made.  
      - Any modifications to one variable do not impact the original.  

---

### **By-Reference (Heap Memory)**  
      - **Used for non-primitive data types** (Objects, Arrays, Functions).  
      - The variable itself is stored in the **stack**, but it holds a **reference** to the actual data in the **heap memory**.  
      - When assigned to a new variable, the reference (memory address) is copied, **not the actual data**.  
      - Both variables point to the same memory location, so **changes made to one affect the other**.  

      **Example Concept:**  
      - If an object is assigned to another variable, both variables reference the same object in memory.  
      - Modifying the object through either variable reflects in both.



***when the value is reassigned in the refrence type, it doesn't affect the previous value:

          let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
          let arr2 = arr1; // Both 'arr1' and 'arr2' reference the same array

          arr2.push(4);    // Modify the array via 'arr2'

          console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (affected)
          console.log(arr2); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (affected)

          arr2 = [5, 6, 7]; // Reassign 'arr2' to a new array

          console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (unchanged)
          console.log(arr2); // [5, 6, 7] (new array)






***********************************************shallowcopy and deepcopy ***********************************
As we know non-primitive data is mutable because it works of refrence structure and when we have to work with that there are high changes of mutability of the original data. To get rid of the problem we came up with these two solution deepcopy and shallowcopy.

**Shallow Copy:**
      it copies the outer layer and give it a new space in memory but still points to the nested data with a refrence.

      common methods to do shallow copy:
      for Arrays: 
       1. spread operator
       2. slice()
       3. concat
       4. array.from
       5. map

       for objects:
       1. Object.assign()
       2. Object.create()
       3. spred operator

**Deep Copy:**
      it copies the nested data as well and give it a new space in memory.    

      for both objects and arrays: 
      1. structuredClone() 
            cons: doesn't support funciton and special objects
      2. JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())
            cons: loses funciton , undefined, date, map,set
      3. recursive cloning (manually)
            cons: requires manual handling for every thing like date, map ,set
      4. Lodash’s cloneDeep()
         needs to install external library npm i lodash

### **Understanding Stack and Heap Memory**  

          Stack and Heap are **memory management regions** in a computer’s **RAM**. They are not data structures in the traditional sense (like arrays or linked lists), nor are they just pieces of code designed for optimization. Instead, they are physical locations in **RAM** where data is stored and managed efficiently during program execution.  

          ---

          ### **Stack Memory**  
          - **Location**: Resides in the **RAM**.  
          - **Purpose**: Used for storing **function execution context, local variables, and primitive values**.  
          - **Structure**: Works like a **stack data structure (LIFO - Last In, First Out)**.  
          - **Speed**: **Faster** compared to heap memory because allocation and deallocation are automatic.  
          - **Management**: Memory is allocated when a function is called and automatically **freed** when the function returns.  

          **Key Characteristics:**  
          - Stores **primitive values** and function call frames.  
          - Has a **fixed size**, so it can overflow if too much memory is used (stack overflow).  
          - **Efficient and fast** due to automatic memory allocation and deallocation.  

          ---

          ### **Heap Memory**  
          - **Location**: Also resides in the **RAM**.  
          - **Purpose**: Used for storing **objects, arrays, and functions (non-primitive data types)**.  
          - **Structure**: Does not follow a structured order like a stack; data is stored **dynamically** at any available memory location.  
          - **Speed**: **Slower** than stack memory because allocation and deallocation happen manually via garbage collection.  
          - **Management**: Memory is **allocated dynamically** and remains allocated until it is explicitly freed (or garbage-collected).  

          **Key Characteristics:**  
          - Stores **non-primitive values** (objects, arrays, functions).  
          - Provides **flexibility**, as memory is allocated dynamically.  
          - Requires **manual memory management**, though JavaScript's garbage collector handles cleanup.  
          - Can lead to **memory leaks** if objects are not properly dereferenced.  

          ---

          ### **Summary: Stack vs. Heap**
          | Feature | Stack Memory | Heap Memory |
          |---------|-------------|-------------|
          | **Speed** | Fast | Slower |
          | **Storage** | Function execution context, local variables, primitive values | Objects, arrays, functions (non-primitives) |
          | **Size** | Fixed size | Dynamic size |
          | **Access** | LIFO (Last In, First Out) | Random, dynamic allocation |
          | **Allocation** | Automatic (managed by JS engine) | Manual (managed via garbage collection) |
          | **Risk** | Stack overflow (if too much recursion or large variables) | Memory leaks (if objects are not dereferenced) |

          ---

          ### **Are Stack and Heap Physical or Logical?**  
          Stack and heap are **not separate physical components**; they are **logical divisions** within the **RAM**. The **operating system** and the **JavaScript engine** manage them based on program execution needs.

          - **Stack is used for structured, temporary storage.**  
          - **Heap is used for flexible, long-term storage.**  

          Both work together to ensure efficient memory management and program execution.
