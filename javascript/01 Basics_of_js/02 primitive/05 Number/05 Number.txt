/* Why isn't NaN equal to itself?
The behavior of NaN is defined by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, which JavaScript follows. 
According to this standard:

NaN is not equal to any value, including itself.
This design choice was made because NaN represents an undefined or unrepresentable value, and comparing 
two NaN values would not make sense. They don't signify the same "value" but rather the concept of an 
invalid number. */
