JavaScript Math Library - Interview Questions:
How do you round a number to the nearest integer in JavaScript?
Answer: To round a number to the nearest integer, you can use the Math.round() method.

What is the difference between 'Math.round()' and 'Math.floor()'?
Answer: Math.round() rounds a number to the nearest integer, while Math.floor()
rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

How do you round a number up to the nearest integer in JavaScript?
Answer: To round a number up to the nearest integer, you can use the Math.ceil() method.

What does 'Math.random()' return? 
Answer: Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

How can you generate a random number between a given range (e.g., 1 and 100)?
Answer: To generate a random number between a given range, you can use the Math.floor() method.
ex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

How would you calculate the square root of a number in JavaScript? Which method would you use?
Answer: To calculate the square root of a number, you can use the Math.sqrt() method.

What is the result of 'Math.pow(2, 3)'? What does the 'Math.pow()' function do?
Answer: Math.pow(2, 3) returns the result of 2 raised to the power of 3, which is 8.

How would you find the minimum or maximum value from a set of numbers in JavaScript?
Answer: To find the minimum or maximum value from a set of numbers, you can use the Math.min()
or Math.max() methods.\
ex: Math.min(1, 2, 3); // 1
    Math.max(1, 2, 3); // 3

How do you convert a number to a specific base in JavaScript, such as binary or hexadecimal?
Answer: To convert a number to a specific base, you can use the toString() method.
ex: 10.toString(2); // "1010"
    10.toString(16); // "a"

For a **MERN stack developer**, binary, octal, and hexadecimal conversions are relevant in the
 following contexts:

1. **Web Development (Hex Colors):** Hexadecimal values are used for color codes in CSS/HTML.
 Developers may convert them to decimal RGB for dynamic themes or UI manipulation.  
2. **Cryptography and Security:** Hexadecimal tokens (e.g., JWTs, API keys) are used in
 authentication and security, requiring parsing or manipulation.  
3. **Database Debugging (MongoDB):** MongoDB IDs (ObjectId) are in hexadecimal format,
 and developers might convert them for readability or debugging.

What is the difference between 'Math.sin()' and 'Math.cos()' in JavaScript? 
Give an example of each.
Answer: Math.sin() returns the sine of a number, while Math.cos() returns the cosine of a number.
ex: Math.sin(Math.PI / 2); // 1

How do you calculate the logarithm of a number in JavaScript? What is the difference between 
'Math.log()' and 'Math.log10()'?
Answer: To calculate the logarithm of a number, you can use the Math.log() method.
ex: Math.log(10); // 2.3025850929940457
