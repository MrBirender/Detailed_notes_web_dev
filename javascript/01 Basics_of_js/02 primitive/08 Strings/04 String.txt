const str = "Hello World";

const str1 = new String("Hello World");
* using this customProperty can be added:
srt1.customProperty = "Birender";
console.log(str1.customProperty)// Birender this is more of like an object.

console.log(typeof str); // Output: "string"
console.log(typeof str1); // Output: "object" [String: 'Hello World']

**In summary, new String() creates a string object, while string literals are primitive strings.
 The need for new String() is extremely rare in modern JavaScript. Stick to literals unless
 an object-specific behavior is required.
 string literal are sufficent in most of the cases.

 string has two things in console.log
1. length
2. methods

These can be directly accessed by using dot notation.
ex. console.log(str.length)
