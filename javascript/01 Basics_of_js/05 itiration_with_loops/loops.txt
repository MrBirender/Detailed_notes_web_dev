        1. **Basic Questions**
          - Write a loop to reverse an array.
          - Sum all even numbers in an array using a loop.
          - Find duplicates in an array using loops.

        2. **Comparison**
          - What is the difference between `for`, `for...in`, and `for...of`?
          - Why should you avoid `for...in` with arrays?

          - What happens when you use `break` or `continue` in a loop?
          - How do you loop through a Map or Set?

        4. **Optimization**
          - How would you optimize nested loops for performance?
          - Can you write a loop that breaks on a condition but continues outer iterations?

        5. **Real-world Problems**
          - Write a loop to flatten a nested array.
          - Iterate over an object and calculate the sum of numeric values.
