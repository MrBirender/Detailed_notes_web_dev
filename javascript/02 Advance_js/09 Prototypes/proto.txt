Q1. what are prototypes in js?
Answer: Prototypes are a mechanism in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties 
and methods from other objects, creating a hierarchy of objects.
It is a way to reuse code and create a more modular and reusable structure for your code.
Q2. what is prototype chain and why evrthing is an object.
Q3. can every data type including function behave like an object. like accessing property using
dot notation.

function sayHai(name){
    console.log(`Hai ${name}`)
}

sayHai.age = 25

const result = sayHai('Birender')
console.log(result) // Hello Birender
console.log(sayHai.age) //25

#@#$ => EVERTHING non-primitve data type in js . when consoled in the boroser.
firstly gives the prototype of its self having fucntion and properties what it can do
after that it give prototypes of objects and in the end of those it gives setProto()
and setProto() to further increase the chain.
