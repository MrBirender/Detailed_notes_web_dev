Question: What is the use of call, apply and bind in js?
      Answer: These methods are used to the context of this in js functions.

call: call is used when you now the exact numbers of arguments which are going to be passed.
      ex: 
        function greet(city, country) {
            console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name} from ${city}, ${country}`);
        }

        const user = { name: "Birender" };

        greet.call(user, "Gurgaon", "India"); 
        // Output: Hello, I am Birender from Gurgaon, India


apply: this work same as call does but with this we can pass an array of arguments:

        function greet(city, country) {
            console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name} from ${city}, ${country}`);
        }

        const user = { name: "Birender" };

        greet.apply(user, ["Gurgaon", "India"]); 
        // Output: Hello, I am Birender from Gurgaon, India



bind: it doesn't invoke imediately but returns a function with the specefied this value which can be called later.

        function greet(city) {
            console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name} from ${city}`);
        }

        const user = { name: "Birender" };

        const greetUser = greet.bind(user, "Gurgaon");

        greetUser(); 
        // Output: Hi, I am Birender from Gurgaon


Note: this never points to the function insted it points to the context of that function
