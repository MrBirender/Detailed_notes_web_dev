step1. create Store
step2. import that store in index.js and import provider from react-redux and then
wrap the app in provider and pass the store as a prop to provider.


step3. 
 a. create featuers directroy
 b. create counter directroy with in it.
 c. inside it create counterSlice.js using createSlice method of toolkit.
 d. define initialState and then define counterSlice which is also an object.
 e. inside counterSlice {
export const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState,
    reducers:{
        increment: (state) => {
            state.count += 1
        },

        decrement: (state) => {
            state.count -= 1
        },

    }
})
f. and at last exprot them
{
    
export const {increment, decrement} = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer
}}

step4. configure that counterReducer in store.


Q. how to async operations in redux?
answer: use thunk
what does thunk mean? 
    A peace of code that does some delayed work.
