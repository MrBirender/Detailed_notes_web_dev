Question: What is React?
    Answer: React is a js library used of building user interfaces , particulary for the single page applications where you need a fast, interactive ui.

Key Features of React: 
    1. COMPONENT BASED ARCHITECTURE: 
    2. VIRTUAL DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)
    3. DECLARAIVE SYNTAX.
    4. JSX (JAVASCRIPT AND XML)
    5. UNIDIRECTIONAL DATA FLOW
    6. HOOKS (FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT)
    7. ECOSYSTEM AND TOOLS



### **Question: How JavaScript and React Work Behind the Scenes?**  
**Answer:**  
        When working with a **Vanilla JavaScript** project, we manually update the DOM using DOM manipulation methods like `.innerHTML`, `.innerText`, `.textContent`, etc.  

        ‚û°Ô∏è This manipulation does **not re-render the entire page**. JavaScript efficiently identifies the affected area and updates only that part of the DOM.

### **React‚Äôs Approach:**  
        React and JavaScript both aim to update only the necessary parts of the DOM, but the key difference lies in:  
        ‚úÖ **Efficiency** ‚Äî How React optimizes updates.  
        ‚úÖ **Automation** ‚Äî How React reduces manual effort.

### **How React Works:**  
        1. **Virtual DOM Creation:**  
        - React creates a **lightweight copy** of the original DOM called the **Virtual DOM** (a JavaScript object that mimics the real DOM structure).  

        2. **Change Detection:**  
        - Whenever there‚Äôs a change in the UI (due to state/props updates), React creates a **new Virtual DOM**.  
        - React then compares the **previous Virtual DOM** with the **new Virtual DOM** using a process called the **Diffing Algorithm**.  

        3. **Efficient DOM Updates:**  
        - After identifying the changes, React efficiently updates only the affected parts of the **Real DOM** using DOM manipulation methods like `.innerHTML`, `.innerText`, etc.  

        4. **Reconciliation Process:**  
        - To further improve performance, React optimizes updates by batching multiple changes together. This process is known as **Reconciliation**, which prevents unnecessary re-rendering and improves performance.

### **Key Difference in Simple Terms:**  
        üîπ **JavaScript** ‚Üí Manually detects and updates the DOM.  
        üîπ **React** ‚Üí Automatically tracks changes, efficiently updates the DOM, and optimizes performance using the **Virtual DOM** and **Reconciliation**.  

        This automation makes React powerful for building complex, high-performance web applications. üöÄ
