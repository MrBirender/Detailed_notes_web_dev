      Here's an intentional encoding error:
      <p>üçé</p> <!-- Emoji that won't display correctly in ISO-8859-1 -->
      <p>‰Ω†Â•Ω</p> <!-- Chinese characters that won't display correctly in ISO-8859-1 -->
      <p>‡§π‡•à‡§≤‡•ã</p> <!-- Hindi characters that won't display correctly in ISO-8859-1 -->
      <p>œÄ</p> <!-- Greek letter that won't display correctly in ISO-8859-1 -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>


<!-- Why do we use <!DOCTYPE html>?
To tell the browser we're using HTML5 and avoid quirks mode.
Sure! Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Quirks Mode (Without `<!DOCTYPE html>`)**:
   - The browser uses an old, inconsistent box model where **padding and borders** are **included in width**.
   - This leads to unpredictable behavior, such as strange spacing, layout issues, and inconsistent rendering across browsers.

2. **`box-sizing: border-box` (With `<!DOCTYPE html>`)**:
   - This is a **modern CSS property** that **explicitly includes padding and borders** in the element's total width and height.
   - It **works consistently across all modern browsers**, making it the recommended method for predictable layout behavior.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - Quirks mode is buggy and unreliable, whereas `box-sizing: border-box` provides **consistent and controlled behavior**.
   - **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** ensures that the browser uses **standards mode**, and using `box-sizing: border-box` keeps your layout predictable.

4. **Best Practice**:  
   - Always use `<!DOCTYPE html>` to avoid quirks mode.
   - Apply `box-sizing: border-box` for predictable sizing behavior across all elements.

What is the purpose of the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag?
It ensures proper encoding for all characters.
To simulate and see character encoding glitches in the browser:

1. **Remove the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag**: This will force the browser to guess the encoding, which might cause issues with special characters, like emojis or non-ASCII characters, displaying incorrectly.

2. **Set an incorrect charset (e.g., `ISO-8859-1`)**: By using an incorrect encoding, characters outside the supported range (e.g., emojis or non-Latin text) will be displayed incorrectly (garbled or as question marks).

3. **Expected Outcome**: If the charset is missing or incorrect, characters like emojis üçé, Chinese ‰Ω†Â•Ω, or Hindi text will appear as garbled text, such as `√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö¬°` or `√É∆í√Ç¬≠`.

By either removing the charset or setting it incorrectly, you‚Äôll see these display issues. Alternatively, you can manually change encoding in Developer Tools for a similar effect.

This demonstrates the importance of specifying the correct charset (like UTF-8) for proper character rendering.

What does the viewport meta tag do?
It makes the page responsive on all devices.

What are defer and async in scripts?
defer: Executes after the HTML is parsed.
async: Executes as soon as it's downloaded, ignoring the order.


Why is the <title> tag important?
It sets the page title, helping SEO and user experience.

What does the lang attribute do?
It specifies the page language for SEO and accessibility.
Changing the lang attribute helps search engines and other tools 
understand the language of your page, and it can be helpful for accessibility 
and correct rendering. So, yes, 
you can change it to any supported language to reflect the content's language.

Why is the <head> section important?
It contains meta information that helps browsers, search engines, and developers. -->
